# BSCchainexplorer
This JavaScript project is an application that can be used to fetch data from the BSCScan mainnet API. The application retrieves a list of transactions from a given startblock and endblock and then filters out the addresses with a balance higher than 2BNB. 

Once the data has been retrieved, it can be downloaded into a .csv file. 

To use this application, simply click the 'Connect' button. This will initiate a GET request to the BSCScan API. Once the request has been successful, click the 'Fetch data' button to begin filtering out addresses with a balance greater than 2BNB. 

Once the data has been filtered, click the 'Download CSV' button to download the data into a .csv file. 

The application also displays the request status and response data in the console.
